= POpen4
This is a repackaged version of John-Mason P. Shackelfords {POpen4}[http://popen4.rubyforge.org/]
gem without native libraries.

== About this fork
This fork adds the compatibility with the MINGW compiled ruby for windows. MINGW is the compilation method used by Ruby Installer (http://rubyinstaller.org/).

== Description
POpen4 provides the Rubyist a single API across platforms for executing a
command in a child process with handles on stdout, stderr, stdin streams as well
as access to the process ID and exit status. It does very little other than to
provide an easy way to use either Ara Howard's Open4 library or the win32-popen3
library by Park Heesob and Daniel Berger depending on your platform and without
having to code around the slight differences in their APIs.

== Notes
Rather than adopting either Open4's API or win32-open3's (they differ in several
respects, but most obviously in the order in which streams are passed to the
block) I am proposing a third API for couple of reasons. First, Open4 passes the
PID first and win32-open3 passes stdin neither of which seem to me to be the
streams we are most likely to use when we don't need all four. POpen4 passes
stdout and stderr first so that when the others are not required we can omit
them from the block. Second, I thought it best to break everybody's code rather
than to be a drop in replacement on one platform and be a surprise on another.
No surprises--it's a new API on either platform.

== Installation

   $ gem install POpen4 --source http://gemcutter.org

== Acknowledgements
Ara Howard, Park Heesob, Daniel Berger and others have done the real work. Many
thanks to them for the many hours they have poured into sharing their work with
the Ruby community at large.
